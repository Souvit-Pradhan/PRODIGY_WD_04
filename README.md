During my internship, I created a personal portfolio website to showcase my web development projects and skills. The portfolio features a clean and modern design, highlighting my work through interactive elements and responsive layouts. I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a seamless user experience across various devices. This project not only demonstrated my technical abilities but also allowed me to express my personal brand and creative vision as a developer. It served as a valuable tool for sharing my work with potential employers and clients.
